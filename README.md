This project attempts to pull data from Google API and save the results to Mongo DB hosted locally (not deployed)

Full disclaimer - I used coding sunset starter code and took a look at the solutions to try to modify the axios get request from Google API. Apologies for the Frankenstein-nature of it!

I spent ~ 15 hours on this and so I feel comfortable submitting although it does not work. The full stack projects are a bit beyond my understanding with the time I've been committing to the course.
